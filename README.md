# Disk-Based AVL Tree Implementation in Java

## Overview

This project presents an implementation of an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree stored on disk rather than in memory. This implementation maintains the AVL tree properties and allows basic operations such as insertions, deletions, and searches.

## Features

- Disk-based storage: Ideal for managing larger-than-memory data sets.

- AVL Tree: Self-balancing binary search tree.

## Requirements

- Java 8

- Gradle 8.0

- JUnit for testing

## Personal Note

This project encapsulates an intriguing technical challenge I encountered during a job interview. While its implementation is straightforward, I felt it was worth preserving.

I've been experiencing significant stress at work, leading to a sense of depression. I'm not sure what could lift my spirits at the moment, but revisiting and sharing this project is a small step in that direction, even when things feel tough :(
